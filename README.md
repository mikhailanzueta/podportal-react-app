# Pod Portal React:
Pod Portal is a full-stack web application that uses the MERN tech stack. 
Pod Portal allows users to listen to different podcasts that we currently provide.
Pod Portal was developed during the months of January - June  of 2024.
Pod Portal uses a mongoDB database to store user information and podcast information.
Users are allowed to create an account and login to that account.

# Future Updates:
There will be future additions to Pod Portal to make it more dynamic than it is now.
More third party data will be used to provide more content.
More CRUD operations will be implemented for user profile functionality.
A playlist feature will be developed for users who create or already have an account with us.

# User Feedback:
Pod Portal is now a live web application and available for widespread use.
